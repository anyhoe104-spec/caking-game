# Project worklog

This file is the shared source of truth for cross-device and cross-agent handoffs. Keep the current handoff concise and preserve dated reports as an append-only history.

## Current handoff

- Updated: 2026-08-14 15:32 +09:00 (Asia/Tokyo)
- Agent: Codex
- Branch: `agent/refresh-project-docs` (synchronized with `origin/agent/refresh-project-docs`)
- Last commit: `309e989 Add shared agent handoff workflow`
- Objective: Establish a repeatable start/end workflow for development across multiple PCs and agents.
- Completed:
  - Added repository-scoped start, checkpoint, and work-report article skills.
  - Added `AGENTS.md` so agents without skill support follow the same workflow.
  - Established this combined handoff and dated work-report format.
- In progress:
  - Confirm the workflow on the mobile PC after cloning and switching to `agent/refresh-project-docs`.
- Blockers and risks:
  - This repository is stored under OneDrive; use GitHub, rather than simultaneous OneDrive synchronization, as the source of code synchronization between PCs.
  - The workflow commit is not merged into `main`; cloning the default branch alone will not include it yet.
- Next actions:
  1. On the mobile PC, clone `caking-game` and switch to `agent/refresh-project-docs`.
  2. Invoke `$resume-project` in a new task and confirm repository-scoped skill discovery.
  3. When ready, merge `agent/refresh-project-docs` into `main` so future clones receive the workflow by default.
- Validation: All three skills passed `quick_validate.py`; `git diff --check` passed; the common-template installer passed a clean-repository smoke test.

## Dated work reports

### 2026-08-14 — Codex

- Objective: Create reusable workflows for starting work and ending or handing off work.
- Work completed:
  - Created `$resume-project` to inspect Git and this report before resuming.
  - Created `$checkpoint-project` to update the current handoff and append a dated agent report.
  - Created `$write-work-report` to produce evidence-based articles from this report.
  - Created `AGENTS.md` as a compatible fallback contract for agents without Codex skill support.
  - Designed the report to serve both as a work history and as instructions for another agent.
- Files and areas changed:
  - `.agents/skills/resume-project/`
  - `.agents/skills/checkpoint-project/`
  - `.agents/skills/write-work-report/`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `WORKLOG.md`
- Validation:
  - `resume-project`: passed `quick_validate.py`.
  - `checkpoint-project`: passed `quick_validate.py`.
  - `write-work-report`: passed `quick_validate.py`.
  - Repository changes: passed `git diff --check`.
- Decisions:
  - Store the skills inside the repository so GitHub distributes them to both PCs.
  - Remove same-named user-global copies to avoid duplicate skill discovery.
  - Keep current state at the top and append historical reports below.
  - Require explicit authorization before commit or push.
- Unresolved issues:
  - Confirm the skills appear after Codex reloads or starts a new task.
- Next actions:
  1. Inspect the final Git diff.
  2. Commit and push when requested.

### 2026-08-14 15:32 +09:00 — Codex

- Objective: Publish and hand off the shared cross-device and cross-agent workflow.
- Work completed:
  - Committed the repository-scoped workflow as `309e989 Add shared agent handoff workflow`.
  - Pushed `agent/refresh-project-docs` to `origin` and verified the branch is synchronized.
  - Created the private GitHub repository `anyhoe104-spec/agent-project-workflow` as the reusable template source.
  - Added a safe PowerShell installer that refuses to overwrite existing workflow files unless `-Force` is explicitly supplied.
  - Clarified that CAKING development needs only the `caking-game` clone; the template repository is optional for installing the workflow elsewhere.
- Files and areas changed:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `WORKLOG.md`
  - `.agents/skills/resume-project/`
  - `.agents/skills/checkpoint-project/`
  - `.agents/skills/write-work-report/`
  - External template repository: `anyhoe104-spec/agent-project-workflow`
- Validation:
  - All three skills passed `quick_validate.py`.
  - `git diff --check` passed before publication.
  - The template installer successfully installed the expected files into a temporary empty Git repository.
  - Local branch and remote branch both pointed to `309e989` before this report update.
- Decisions:
  - Keep project execution rules and skills inside each project repository.
  - Keep reusable source templates in the separate private template repository.
  - Do not require cloning the template repository merely to develop CAKING.
- Unresolved issues:
  - `agent/refresh-project-docs` has not been merged into `main`.
  - Repository-scoped skill discovery has not yet been confirmed on the mobile PC.
- Next actions:
  1. Clone `caking-game` on the mobile PC and switch to `agent/refresh-project-docs`.
  2. Start a new Codex task and invoke `$resume-project`.
  3. Merge the workflow branch into `main` after confirming the desired integration path.
